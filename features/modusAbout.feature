Feature: Modus About Page
  To establish that our website has an About Page
  As a user, I want to ensure that our Home page has a link to the about page

  Scenario: Verify About Page Link
    Given I open the Modus Create home page
    And the title is "Modus Labs by Modus Create"
    # And the title "Modus Create - HTML5 Application Development & Training"
    Then the About Page link exists
